# Hanging Man Game

This repository is a game, created in c# - Windows Forms.<br>
I created it in my own time, when I wanted to learn how to use Windows Forms and improve my c# skills.<br>
Its a game for two:
1. The second player closes their eyes, while the first person writes a category, for example "Animals".
2. Then he writes a word related to that category, for example "Lion".
3. Then the second player can open their eyes and they try to guess the word based on the category.

The player can guess the word by typing each letter at a time.<br>
If he is correct (the letter exists in the word), the letter will reveal itself in all of its instances in the word.<br>
If he is wrong (the letter doesnt exists in the word) - The hanging man will get closer to dying, for example:
- Put the rope around his head
- Read his will
- Stand on the platform
and so on.

The player must guess the word before the man is dead.
